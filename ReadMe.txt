Hello! This is some more in depth instructions for use of this program.

When the program runs, you will see the command prompt open with it. This doesn't mean anything, but if you run into any errors, they will be displayed there. It will also print out all the data it is iterating through as it runs. This is helpful for debugging purposes. In general, you can ignore it while using the program or refer to it if you encounter any bugs.

The actual program itself is straightforward. First, input the values you are searching for. If you want to search for the magnitude over a range of values (ex. 250.0 - 350.0), you can do that. If you would just like to search at just one value, simply input the same value for both minimum and maximum. All values should be in decimal form, even if its just .0. This step needs to be done before you click the parse files button.

Once you've specified the values you want to search through, you can click "Click to select files" to open file explorer. You can select as many files as you like as long as they are all in the same format as the test files I was provided. Once you've selected your files, hit "OK" and your output file containing the data will be created.

When you want to review your data, you can find it in the output_file.csv which will be located in the same folder as the program and its dependencies. If you remove the file somehow, it will be recreated next time you run the program. Every time the program runs, it rewrites what is currently stored in it, so if you want to keep the data between uses, I would save copies of the file. If you would prefer the data to be appended to the end of file, this is a change I can easily make- so let me know!
